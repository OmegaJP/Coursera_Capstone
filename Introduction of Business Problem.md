# Business Problem

A growing Health Insurance business settled down in Seattle is concerned about the price and conditions of insurance policies related to car accidents. Stakeholders are having a hard time defining new policies and conditions related to coverage and cost of insurances related to car accidents. As no clear overview can be defined, it is clear that more information is needed to make a decision. Increasing the cost of the insurance would highly impact the desire of customers to acquire the service, so stakeholders want to determine what changes can be made to the coverage of the health policy related to car accidents.

**As such, stakeholders have decided that:**

1. They need to know the estimation of the number of accidents in the previous years 
2. From those accidents, how many accidents involve injuries for hospitalization. Fatalities are discarded as they're not covered inside the insurance 
3. Determine a way to predict if a car accident involves the hospitalization of the drivers affected. 


With this information, stakeholders can clearly make decisions on how they should update their policies involving coverage in hospitalization costs related to car accidents. As such, a team of Data analysts was hired to find the necessary information and build a model that can predict the severity of a collision based on the car accident data of the previous years in Seattle. 

Our target audience will be the insurance company, and the customers that acquire the service. The company will highly benefit from the information as if they know and segment their policies depending on the classification of the car accident, they could deduce clauses that would help them reduce costs due to affected customers. Also the customers acquiring the company service can be benefited as they'll be more aware of the type of accidents where they'll get coverage on, and how they could use the insurance service more effectively.
